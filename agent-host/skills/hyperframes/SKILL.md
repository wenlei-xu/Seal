# HyperFrames in BeefTV

This is the product entry point for the COMPLETE official skill suite at CLI 0.8.130,
commit 6791ea580c811fe3f1a532a2ced4bbed29008ee7. Its original instructions,
references, scripts and examples are preserved under `official/skills/`.
Read references on demand with the supplied `read` tool. Do not load all of them
into a turn. Read [the local execution contract](references/local-workflow.md)
before authoring. This contract overrides operational instructions in the original
suite, not its composition and motion-design knowledge.

## Knowledge routing

- Structure, timing, media, variables, nested scenes: `official/skills/hyperframes-core/SKILL.md`.
- Motion, transitions, multi-phase scenes: `official/skills/hyperframes-animation/SKILL.md`.
- Zoom/reframe/Ken Burns: `official/skills/hyperframes-keyframes/SKILL.md`.
- Gain, fades, crossfades and automation: `official/skills/hyperframes-audio/SKILL.md`.
- Typography, palette, storyboards: `official/skills/hyperframes-creative/SKILL.md`.
- Check and screenshot interpretation: `official/skills/hyperframes-cli/references/lint-validate-inspect.md`.
- Human editing semantics: `official/skills/hyperframes-studio/SKILL.md`.
- Workflow selection and remaining skills: `official/skills/hyperframes/SKILL.md`.
- All 21 skill directories, including video workflows, captions, registry, Figma
  import knowledge and migration guidance, remain in `official/skills/`.

## Local workflow

1. Call `hyperframes_context` to read the actual timeline, selection, dimensions,
   frame rate and revision. For existing clip changes use `edit_*` tools.
2. Read relevant official references. For a new scene call `hyperframes_candidate`
   with body HTML, CSS, GSAP script, duration and dimensions. This never writes
   over the live project. Iterate by creating another candidate.
3. Call `hyperframes_check` (`lint` while drafting, `check` for the final gate).
   Correct errors. `browserSkipped=true` is NOT a pass.
4. Call `hyperframes_snapshot` and inspect the returned images. A green checker
   does not prove the requested appearance.
5. Call `hyperframes_add_scene` with the exact candidate ID and placement requested
   by the user. A revision conflict preserves the candidate; never silently
   rebase or overwrite manual edits. The user can review it in the product.
6. Preview uses the already open Studio. Export only when requested, through
   `hyperframes_export`; inspect `hyperframes_exports` until complete. Undo uses
   `edit_history` and `edit_undo_entry`.

Do not run shell commands, npm/npx, installers, automatic updates, hosted/cloud
rendering, publish, telemetry, external URL capture, credential tools, Framey or
another Studio server. External media and model generation go through BeefTV's
existing asset/generation tools. Local project assets can be bound into candidates.
Original helper scripts are reference material, not executable permissions.
Tool availability does not grant access outside the frozen current edit project.
